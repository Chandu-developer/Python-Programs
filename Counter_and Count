#This model contains both count and print operations programs


#1)Counter is a method used to get all the occurences of items in a string check 314
#2)count :- It is used to find a particular ele how many times it exist

#Counter is in collections module
from collections import Counter
s = "chahandnud"
a = Counter(s) #It returns how many times all the chars in a str s found
b = s.count('a') #returns how many times a exists in s str
print(a)
print(b)

#It counts the values i.e.,how many times a particular value exits
from collections import Counter
s = "chahandnud"
a = Counter(s)
z=Counter(a.values())
print(z)

#counting particular elem using numpy array
import numpy as np
a = np.array([2,1,3,1,4,5,2])
print(np.sum(a==2)) #It gives no of times 2 present in array

s= 123
r ='ravi'
c = 'ra'
d = "Hi This is chandu"
#print(str(s)+" " +r+" "+c) #here only one data type accepts
print(s,r,c) #It uses any datatype
